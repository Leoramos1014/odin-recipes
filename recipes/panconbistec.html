    <H3>An amazing recipe for Pan con bistec</H3>
    <p>Pan con Bistec is a Cuban-style steak sandwich. They can be found in cafeterias and restaurants all over Miami, and they’re delicious. These steak sandwiches are simple to make at home too.</p>
    <H4>Ingredients</H4>
    <ul>
    <li>Steak – You can use any type of thin-sliced beef. Top loin sirloin, palomilla, rib eye, etc.</li>
    <li>Sazon – I used sazon completo, which is a spice blend that includes, oregano, cumin, garlic, powder, salt, and onion powder. It can be found in the Hispanic aisle at your local supermarket.</li> 
    <li>Bread – Ideally you’ll want to use Cuban bread, but feel free to use French or Italian bread.</li> 
    <li>Onions – Pan con bistec isn’t complete without caramelized onions.</li> 
    <li>Garlic Mayo – this is my secret ingredient. Some people don’t add mayo to their pan con bistec sandwiches but I feel like it adds tons of extra flavor.</li> 
    <li>Potato Sticks -adds crunch and saltiness. If you don’t have these on hand, feel free to use crushed potato chips instead.</li> 
    </ul>
    <h4>How to make Pan con Bistec</h4>
        <OL>
<li>Begin by caramelizing the onions. Add the onions to a large skillet with oil and cook over medium-low heat. Season with salt, pepper, and sugar.</li>
<li> While the onions cook, season the steaks with sazon and fresh lime juice. Once the onions are nice and caramelized remove them from the skillet and set them aside.</li>
<li> Add the steaks to the skillet and cook over medium-high heat for 2-3 minutes on each side. While the steaks cook, add 2 minced garlic cloves to the mayo and mix well. Season the mayo with salt.</li>
<li> Add 1-2 tbsp of mayo to the bread along with the steak, caramelized onions, and potato sticks. Brush the bread with some butter and cook in a panini press according to manufacturer instructions.</li>
